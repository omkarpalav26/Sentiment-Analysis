Introduction:
This repository contains the code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on news articles related to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment of news articles about DJIA and gain insights into how the sentiments affect the stock market.

Project Overview:
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we will use the VADER Sentiment Analysis library to analyze the sentiment of news articles related to DJIA. The VADER library is well-suited for social media text and informal language, making it ideal for analyzing news articles' sentiment.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of news articles related to DJIA, along with their publication dates. The data was collected from various reliable news sources, and each article is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on its content.
Please note that the dataset used in this project is not publicly available due to copyright restrictions. However, you can adapt the code to work with your own dataset or other publicly available datasets on sentiment analysis.

Installation:
To run the sentiment analysis code, you will need to have Python and the required dependencies installed. 

Results:
The output of the sentiment analysis will include sentiment scores for each news article, along with the overall sentiment trend over time. I have visualized the results using Tableau and Matplotlib.
